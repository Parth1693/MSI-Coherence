Coherence Protocol Notes:
1. Check state and then respond
2. Different parts for processor and bus transactions
3. Go to correct next state; send bus transaction to OTHER caches
4. Follow FSM for processor side as well as bus side

PrWr - 'w'
PrRd - 'r'
BusRd - 'd'
BusRdX - 'x'
BusUpgrade - ‘u’
BusUpdate - ‘p’
